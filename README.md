- 👋 Hi, I’m Hyan Guimarães (@hyanguimaraes), born in Brazil and father to a princess. With the main goal to change carrers and become a full-time Software Engineer.
- 👀 I’m learning how to program from scratch, mostly through research and online courses like the ones on Alura.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Alura's Beginner Programmer Training. I've started with Programming logics and now, Front-End programming, creating my first professional pages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and with anyone who is pacient enough to teach someone who's learning a new profession from scratch.
